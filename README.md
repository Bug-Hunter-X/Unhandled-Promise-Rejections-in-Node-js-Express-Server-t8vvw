This repository demonstrates a common issue in Node.js applications: unhandled promise rejections.  The original `server.js` demonstrates a server that can hang after numerous requests due to the asynchronous nature of the request handling.  The solution, `serverSolution.js`, demonstrates proper error handling that prevents this issue.  The problem arises from the asynchronous nature of the `setTimeout` function and the lack of error handling.  Without proper error handling, any errors within the `setTimeout` callback won't be caught, leading to potential crashes.  The solution shows the importance of comprehensive error handling in asynchronous Node.js code.
